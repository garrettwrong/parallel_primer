* I'm not a highly experienced C++ developer, novice/moderate.

Note that I used "-o2" on purpose.
Internally that is how most of the code backing Python is compiled.
It is also a common default.
If using more advanced optimization C, C++, and CUDA pull away even farther.
Approximately another 10-20% or so on my machine.
